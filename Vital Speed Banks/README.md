# Workflow
1) Select bank components (presets, tables, lfos, samples) from a file browser to add to each list individually, or use "Auto Add" to select a folder of components to add automatically--components from subfolders are also included.
2) Name your bank and press "EXPORT", choosing the directory to export it to

# "Advanced"
- Using the labled checkboxes underneath the action buttons allows you to specify which components to affect (e.g. pressing "Auto Add" with only "Wavetables" checked will add only the wavetables from the folder you selected; pressing "Remove All" with all checkboxes enabled will remove all items from each list)

# Keybinds
- [Shift+S] : Send selected wavetable items to the sample list
- [Shift+W] : Send selected sample items to the wavetable lsit
- [Alt+A] : Auto Add
- [Enter/Return] : Export
- [1,2,3,4] : Toggle checks for "Presets","Wavetables","Lfos", and "Samples" respectively.

# List Specific Keybinds
- [Ctrl+A] : Select all items
- [Shift+A] : Add files to the list (Shortcut for the "Add" button)
- [Ctrl+X] : Remove selected items (Shortcut for the "Remove" button)

# FOR MACS
- There is no Mac build because I have no Mac computer
- If you want to run it, you will need to have python on your system (most Macs already do)
- Just download the files, extract, and run the `vital_speed_banking.py` file
- This product has been tested and confirmed to work on a Mac device, good luck.
