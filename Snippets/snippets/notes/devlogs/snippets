After three quarters of a year since snippets was conceived, a half decent version has been completed :)

During this project, I did a lot of things: Lexing and Parsing found in the lexicon_and_parsilos.py file, made an auto-cli for future projects (just my own custom argparser), and completed my first full project documentation!

Things I would do differently next time around:
- Make the parser for modular, and by, flexible.

Future plans:
- Auto-generation of the command table files from class objects
- Macros
- Testing

Bug | March/22/2023 18:09:50
I found a bug... comments are still broken. That is tomorrows problem, I have spent over 12 hours on this project over the last 3 days; it's time for some Shattered Pixel Dungeon.
