Welcome to Mathematic LFO :)

by: SlavaCat

Some programming knowledge is recommended for creating equations!

HOW TO USE-----------------

IF YOU HAVE PYTHON---------

- pip install numpy
- Open code in your editor, make modifications, run the program
- Copy output and right-click the lfo in vital: select 'paste'

IF YOU DON'T HAVE PYTHON---

- Go to programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/
- Open the .py file with notepad, or equivalent program
- Copy the code in your editor, make modifications, run the program
- Copy output and right-click the lfo in vital: select 'paste'

TIPS FOR USE---------------

- Use desmos.com to preview your equation and select a good range
- Math documentation docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
- Select a smaller range and higher resolution
- HEED THE WARNINGS!
- Use the Smoothing knob in Vital to help with non looping equations
- An IMPORTANT thing to note is that the equation results are scaled to fit the vital LFO window, so x+1 would look the exact same as x+2 or x+103049983789634

EXAMPLE EQUATIONS----------

abs(m.sin(x)+m.tan(x))
x/(1/m.sin(x))
x**2/m.cos(x)

*note operators don't need the m. if they aren't found in the documentation: docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS------

- Feel free to message me on the vital forums: forum.vital.audio/u/SlavaCat/
- Also feel free to follow me on soundcloud: soundcloud.com/slavacat I'm releasing 2 new songs on 3/22/21 :)
- I've also included some example LFO's for you to use of various trig functions

If you make anything cool, be sure to let me know :)
