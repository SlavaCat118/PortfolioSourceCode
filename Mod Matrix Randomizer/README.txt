Welcome to MOD MATRIX RANDOMIZER! By me, SlavaCat

How to Use:

STEP ONE,
- Put your preset(s) to randomize in the "presets_here" folder.
- I would recommend only putting 1 or 2 because the amount of presets that you input to create will be multiplied by the amount of presets in this folder. 
- ex: having 5 presets in 'presets_here' and inputing 10 into preset creation amount, will result in 50 new files; be careful.
- I would also recommend starting with some of the already provided templates

STEP TWO:
- Run the "Mod Matrix Randomizer" application. (should take about 5 seconds to boot up)
- Fill out every input box/menu correctly or else errors will occur.

STEP THREE:
- Press "Generate"
- The program will close, and depending on how many presets you wanted to create, they will appear in the "final_presets" folder quickly.

Parameter Help:
"Enter in the amount of new presets you want"
- Determines the amount of new randomized presets that are created by running the program. 
- It will limit you to 10 to make sure you don't destroy your system.

"Enter the amount of modulations you want (1-64)"
- Determines the amount of modulations that will be found in the mod matrix, recommended to be between 10-30

"Source restrictions?"
- Determines how the sources are restricted. 
- "restrict to macros" will restrict all modulation sources to macro controllers
- "no source restrictions" will have all sources be available for use

Tips for Use:
- For the types of presets you put in to be randomized, I would recomend having most things filled out, but disabled. If your confused as to what I mean, just looks at some of the default templates provided.
- This is meant to be a source of inspiration and not a sound design factory. Generate smaller batches of presets and modify them to fit your liking.
